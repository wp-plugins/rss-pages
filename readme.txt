Replace the normal posts rss feeds with the rss feeds of pages.

== Description ==

One problem with Wordpress is that the RSS feed only contains the latests posts and not pages. The idea I suppose is to have a feed which the blogosphere can use to know when there is updated news on your site. That's ok for most Wordpress sites but when you are using as Wordpress as a CMS and thus using pages and not posts you can't put the pages into a feed. 

Note: This plugin replace your posts feed with page feeds.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `rss-pages.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/rss-pages/` directory
2. Activate the `rss-pages plugin` through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done - Your feeds will now include pages and not posts
4. If you are using a wordpress version below 2.6 you will need to patch
Wordpress with the patch found here [Wordpress Add_Feed Bug and
Fix](http://programming.has.no.com/2008/05/14/wordpress-add_feed-bug-fix/
